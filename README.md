# Prog2007 prosjekt

This is a flashcard app we developed during our Mobile Programming class at NTNU university.
In this android app you can create flashcard sets of whatever you want. The app
also automatically creates quizes and mach making games out of the users flashcard
sets. All data is stored locally on your Android device ensuring the user's privacy.
